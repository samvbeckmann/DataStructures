# Data Structures
This repository contains the projects for my Data Structures class.

### Project 1: Bank Simulation
This project simulated many customers visiting a set of tellers in a bank. The project was about event-driven programming
and priority queues.

### Project 2: Skyline
This project was about creating a data structure to parse an input file and that contains coordinates for a skyline.
The goal was to be able to create a visualization of the skyline from the file.

### Project 3: Hashing
This project was about analyzing the properties of a hash map under different load factors with varying hash functions.
